Best Practices
Branch naming convention

Always separate words with hyphens (“-”).
Use descriptive branch names.
Use all lowercase.
If there is a jira ticket for the issue/feature being addressed in the branch, include it at the beginning of the branch name.

Examples:

“jira-1234-user-login-style-improvements”

Commit Messages:

Keep your commit messages succinct yet descriptive.

Example:
“Fixed slider bug on index page”


Submitting a QA Request
When submitting a QA request, please include the branch name at the top of the request description. Example:
branch: colorscheme-tool-improvements

Submitting a Merge Request
When submitting a merge request in GitLab, please include the following in the merge request description:
jira ticket number
the text: “passed QA”

Git Shell Tips

Tab Completion
To complete a git command without typing the entire command in manually, use tab completion.  If a command name doesn’t complete, the characters you entered are not unique. In that case press the tab key twice in a row.

Command History
Use the “up arrow” and “down arrow” keys to navigate through your command history.
